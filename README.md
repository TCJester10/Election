## Election
# python analysis of colorado electrion district results

# Overview
In order to better understand an election, I looked at the vote breakdown 3 counties in colorado 
Arapahoe, Denver, and Jefferson, and the 3 candidates who were in the race as well. 
Charles Casper Stockham, Diana DeGette: 73.8%, and Raymon Anthony Doane. To analyze it, I used Python
to look into how the total votes from all three counties were distributed among the three candidates 
and how the total votes were distributed among the three counties.

# What was done
* Took a csv with all vote data

* Used Python to store the voting data and sort it
  * First, the data was sorted by candidates total votes
  * Then, it was sorted by votes by county

#Things that can done in the future
